# CodeSentinel

CodeSentinel is an intelligent code review automation system that leverages AI to provide instant, comprehensive code reviews for your GitHub repositories. By integrating directly with GitHub webhooks, CodeSentinel automatically analyzes code changes and provides detailed feedback on code quality, potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to best practices.
